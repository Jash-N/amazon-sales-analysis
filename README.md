- Lower-cost products tend to receive significant discounts, making them attractive to customers.

- Higher discount percentages **did not** consistently lead to better product ratings, steeper discounts were associated with a decline in customer rating in some cases.

## Suggested Actions
- Optimize Inventory for High-Demand Categories
      -Capitalize on the popularity of USB cables (top-selling product) by increasing stock levels, bundle with complementary items (e.g., adapters) to enhance sales momentum.

- Conduct testing on discount percentages for low-cost items to identify thresholds that maximize sales volume without negatively impacting customer ratings such as avoiding steep discounts linked to rating declines.

- Improving Post-purchase experience by addressing potential quality or expectation gaps by enhancing product descriptions using customer feedback.
